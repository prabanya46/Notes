GPIO - Genral Purpose Input Output
uses
    Reading digital signals
    Issuing interrupts
    Generating triggers for external components
GPIO Pin - Generic pin whose value consists of one of two voltage settings can be programmed through software
GPIO Port - Defined grouping of GPIO pins(STM32 16 pins)

One pin can be programed as GPIO pin or USART pin this is called multiplexing

Input 
    After reset GPIO is default to input mode
    Default GPIO pins will be high Z state or floating state
    Keeping pins in high Z state leads to more power consumption
By connecting resistor input can be made stable 
    Internal pull down
    Internal pull up
Output
     Open drain state
     Pull up
     Push Pull configuration
Clock should be enabled to make the peripheral work.
