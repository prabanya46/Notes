parallel communication - 8 bit data is transferred the same time
serial communication - 8 bit data is transferred one bit at a time 

serial communication 
         Synchronous - clock is transmitted with the data
         Asynchronous - no clock is transmitted. Transmitter and reciever agree on the clock speed for the data transmission(baud rate)

UART - Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter

Duplex - data can be transmitted and reciever
Simplex - data can be transmitted only or recieved only
Half duplex - data can be transmitted in only one way at a time
Full duplex - data can be transmitted in both ways at a time 

UART is full duplex

In asynchronous transmission it is packed between start and stop bit

parity - used for error checking 
      even parity
      odd parity

mode - reciver or transmitter mode

word length - length of the data (8 bit or 9 bit)
